Paper Summaries

A two paragraph summary of each paper should be turned in at the beginning of each class for papers presented that day. The first paragraph should give a brief summary of the paper. The second paragraph should provide a brief and critical review of the paper’s strengths and weaknesses.

Oral Presentations and Discussions
----------------------------------

Students are required to give two paper presentations and lead a class discussion (typically 15 to 25 minutes each) on a selected assigned paper for that week.
